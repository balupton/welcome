# Welcome to Open Source Maintainers on GitHub!
This GitHub maintainer community is a clique of a few hundred privileged open source maintainers on GitHub to collaborate with each other, and with GitHub, to formulate what we'll consider best practices.

We’ve made this community private to create a safe space for exchanging ideas free from outside scrutiny.

If you’d like:

- to learn open source best practices, check out the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide)
- find open source data for research, check out the [Open Source Survey](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)
- a framework for regular open source contribution, along with resources to help you convince your employers to join in, check out [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)

# How do I join?
We’re starting with a small, but growing, group of maintainers to ensure a good experience. We're relying on nominations from existing members to grow the community at this time.

_What is a maintainer?_ Maintainers are the stewards of an open source project. They spend much of their time thinking about the people and organizational aspects behind the project, beyond the project’s creative output (such as code). Maintainers spend their time reviewing others’ contributions, responding to issues, evangelizing the project, or managing releases.
